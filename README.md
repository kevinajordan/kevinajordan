ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kevinajordan

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building products and services that people want.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m a Principal Machine Learning Engineer during the day. I'm currently learning React, GraphQL, NextJS, and Supabase in my journey to becoming a full stack developer so I can build my ideas out fully.

ğŸ“« Reach me on Twitter @kevin_jordan__

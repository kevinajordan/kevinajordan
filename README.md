👋 Hi, I’m @kevinajordan

👀 I’m interested in building products and services that people want.

🌱 I’m a Senior Technical Product Manager for Cyber AI projects during the day. I'm currently learning React, GraphQL, NextJS, and Supabase in my journey to becoming a full stack developer so I can build my ideas out fully.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on market research on the world's largest problems.

📫 Reach me on Twitter @kevin_jordan__
